Programming and Scripting Project 2021

1.  Introduction

This repository has been created to document my project work for the 2021
Programming and scripting module as part of a Higher Diploma in Data Analytics
with Galway and Mayo Institute of Technology.

Currently in my place of employment, Minitab 18 is used extensively for all data
analysis at a cost of €1709.70 per license [1]. This project concerns the
well-known Fisher’s Iris data set [2] and how it can be analysed using
exploratory data analysis and regression analysis with the Python programming
language.

As Python has been developed under an OSI-approved Open Source license [3] it is
free to use and readily available to anyone. Being able to use Python for data
analysis has a large cost saving implication for my employer.
