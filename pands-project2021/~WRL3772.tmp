Sam Tracey (G00398245) Programming and Scripting Project 2021

Problem Statement:

This project concerns the well-known Fisherâ€™s Iris data set [3]. You must
research the data set and write documentation and code (in Python [1]) to
investigate it. An online search for information on the data set will convince
you that many people have investigated it previously. You are expected to be
able to break this project into several smaller tasks that are easier to solve,
and to plug these together after they have been completed.
