# Messing with modules
# A lot of modules are already installed via Anaconda


# import math
# from math import cos
# from github import Github                         # if a module doesn't exist on your machine use: pip install python-github in the terminal
import math as m

# var = math.cos(3.14)
var = m.cos(3.14)
print(var)
